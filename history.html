                In the midst of the ravages and disasters of World War II, when the world was blinded by evil and power, four world leaders abandoned their usual commands to fight for what they each wanted, emerging as titans determined to shape the world in their own image and likeness. Each of these leaders has their own vision of how the world should be, along with their ambitions and more importantly their desire for absolute power. In this way, they will lead their territories into unparalleled conflict as they seek territorial expansion and the destruction of each of their opponents. 
                <br><br> The world became a battlefield, full of strategy and decision, where skill and diplomacy would be as crucial as weapons in war. These leaders, represented in a very particular way, would become entangled in a struggle for world supremacy.
                <br><br> Red, known as "The Relentless Flame". He dominates the business world by his ferocity and determination, leads a powerful technological nation and total power through a ruthless war machine.
                <br><br> Blue, known as "The Glacial Mind". He masters strategy and diplomacy, a skill set, which makes him truly unstoppable, he leads an advanced nation seeking control of sea and air routes to suffocate his opponents with a network of influence and alliances.
                <br><br> Yellow, known as "The Golden Muse". He masters painting and staging, is obsessed with glory and grandeur, leads a culturally rich nation that seeks artistic and propagandistic conquest, currying favor with the masses as it moves forward.
                <br><br> The green one, known as "The Green Sword". He dominates animal husbandry and biology, in tune with nature and perseverance, he leads an agricultural nation that seeks to expand through gradual conquest and unwavering endurance.
                <br><br> However, the conquest will not be easy. Leaders will face even greater conflicts than they have created and will fight their enemies with bravery and courage, while thinking strategically in their decision making. Time will play a crucial role, the world will be watching their actions, and the leaders' decisions could have lasting and irremediable consequences for their nations and destinies.<br><br>
