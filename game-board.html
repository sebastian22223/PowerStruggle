        <p class="p-map">For the design of the game, a colorful hexagonal board was implemented to serve as the main scenario of the action. On this board, the hexagons are the fundamental tiles that make up the map. Each hexagon has a distinctive color, with shades of blue, red, green and yellow, creating a visually appealing mosaic that is easy to identify. The colors of the hexagonal board are not just aesthetic; they play an important role in the mechanics of the game. Each of these colors symbolizes a faction, allowing players to quickly identify the areas controlled by them and their opponents. In addition, some hexagons are adorned with symbols representing special characteristics.</p>
